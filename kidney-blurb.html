  <h1>Alex Needs A Kidney!</h1>
  My name is Bennett (Alex) Myers and I have end-stage chronic kidney disease
  (CKD). In 2013, when I was 21 years old, I discovered that my kidneys were
  failing with about 20% function remaining. I’ve been on the list to receive a
  deceased donor kidney for about 3 years now but the prospect of receiving a
  kidney through the transplant list is still at least 3 or 4 years away. My
  current kidney function is around 12% and while my condition has generally
  been stable, my doctors tell me that it is highly likely I will need dialysis
  if I keep waiting for a deceased donor kidney.

  I had been holding out hope for my kidneys getting better or for advances
  in artificial/cloned organ technology but after my most recent
  transplant evaluation appointment, I realized that it's time to get
  serious about reaching out to potential living donors. There are many
  reasons why receiving a living donor kidney is ideal:
  <ul>
    <li>As mentioned earlier, dialysis is likely if I don't find a living
      donor. Dialysis, while life-saving, increases risks of heart and bone
    disease, infection, and a decreased life expectancy, as well as a
      decreased quality of life.</li>
    <li>Living donor kidneys tend to last twice as long (around 10 years for
      a deceased donor kidney, and 15-20 for a living donor kidney). Because
      of my age, I will need at least one more kidney transplant after this
      one in my lifetime and so it is important for the transplanted kidney to
      last as long as possible.</li>
    <li>With a living donor, it is possible to time the surgery for the optimal health
      and convenience of both the recipient and the donor.</li>
  </ul>

  The main qualification necessary for becoming a living donor is being in good
  overall physical and mental health. The process involves a thorough medical
  evaluation which involves blood and urine tests, as well as radiological
  imaging and psychological evaluation.

  If it is determined that you are not a match, it is still possible to help by
  donating a kidney through the Kidney Paired Donation program which matches a
  donor-recipient pair with another pair whose donor has a compatible kidney.
  This way, kidney transplant patients with willing but incompatible donors can
  receive compatible kidneys.

  If you are interested in being considered as a living kidney donor, you can
  sign up to fill out an initial donor questionnaire <a
      href="https://pslmc.com/signmeup">here</a> or you can call the donor
  coordinator at 720-754-2155.
