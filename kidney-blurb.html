    <p>My name is Bennett (Alex) Myers and I have end-stage chronic kidney disease
      (CKD). In 2013, when I was 21 years old, I discovered that my kidneys were
      failing with about 20% function remaining. I’ve been on the list to receive a
      deceased donor kidney for about 3 years now but the prospect of receiving a
      kidney through the transplant list is still at least 3 or 4 years away. My
      current kidney function is around 12% and while my condition has generally
      been stable, my doctors tell me that it is highly likely I will need dialysis
      if I keep waiting for a deceased donor kidney.</p>

    <p>I had been holding out hope for my kidneys getting better or for advances
      in artificial/cloned organ technology but after my most recent
      transplant evaluation appointment, I realized that it's time to get
      serious about reaching out to potential living donors. There are many
      reasons why receiving a living donor kidney is ideal:
    <ul>
      <li>As mentioned earlier, dialysis is likely if I don't find a living
        donor. Dialysis, while life-saving, increases risks of heart and bone
        disease, infection, and a decreased life expectancy, as well as a
        decreased quality of life.
      </li>
      <li>Living donor kidneys tend to last twice as long (around 10 years for
        a deceased donor kidney, and 15-20 for a living donor kidney). Because
        of my age, I will need at least one more kidney transplant after this
        one in my lifetime and so it is important for the transplanted kidney to
        last as long as possible.
      </li>
      <li>With a living donor, it is possible to time the surgery for the optimal
        health
        and convenience of both the recipient and the donor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The main qualification necessary for becoming a living donor is being in
      good
      overall physical and mental health. The process involves a thorough medical
      evaluation which involves blood and urine tests, as well as radiological
      imaging and psychological evaluation.</p>

    <p>If it is determined that you are not a match, it is still possible to
      help by
      donating a kidney through the Kidney Paired Donation program which matches a
      donor-recipient pair with another pair whose donor has a compatible kidney.
      This way, kidney transplant patients with willing but incompatible donors can
      receive compatible kidneys.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in being considered as a living kidney donor, you can
      sign up to fill out an initial donor questionnaire <a
          href="https://pslmc.com/signmeup">here</a> or you can call the donor
      coordinator at (720) 754-2155.</p>
